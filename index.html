                      <h2>KRYSTAL CLAIRE</h2>
                       <p>Hi! I am Krystal Claire M. Tabamo, I live in Tondo Masangkay Manila and now I am  first year college 
                        I am 19 years old,  I am the youngest of our siblings. I was born in Mindanao Cagayan de Oro city and my mother's name is Natividad M. Tabamo my father's name is Rico C . Tabamo I have 8 siblings 7 girls and 2 boys, one word that describes me the most is kind being humble and friendly their first expression to me is a friendly one and humble hahaha maybe? What else can describe me? They know me as a bright singer other said that I'm good at singing but for me singing is my expression of everything, every time I'm sad I always sing different types of songs I sing to lessen my stress and sadness, being me is quite good but sometimes it's quite bad hahaha that’s life we all agree that life is not about happiness or sadness it's about how you make your destination with God choosing the right thing to do and added to that I also love to draw or paint, my mom always thought me how to draw she said it comes inside in our hearts, I have a mood swing that not a joke and I get easily nervous fear of shooting and pooping of balloons and I am soft-hearted I get easily cry in dramatic scenes sometimes I am loud sometimes I am quiet sometimes I’m strong Sometimes I’m weak and that’s okay besides I am a joyous women and I'm happy to be me.
